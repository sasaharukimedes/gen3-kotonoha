# Features
Actually, This app is version.3 so I named this repo is gen3-kotonoha.
I developped this webapp with the concept of a "bully-free SNS!
I thought about what I could do to make it so that people can freely and honestly whisper what's on their mind without worrying about anyone else's eyes, and I implemented it.
